    ## Welcome to XAI Validate  

    XAI Validate is powered by [Tic:Toc](https://tictoc.ai), a technology solutions company providing innovative products to make financial services processes faster, smarter and simpler.


    XAI Validate solves for digital financial data validation using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models to distil and render the customers’ financial data into an application decision summary. It is powered by a set of sophisticated normalisation, categorisation and assessment models, supported by an intuitive user interface that allows assessors to interact with and understand your customers' financial data. This will dramatically reduce the time required for assessment and to increase conversion, while ensuring process assurance and credit quality. We prove all technology against our direct to consumer home loans business, [Tic:Toc Home Loans](https://tictoc.com.au/).
     
    If you're a lender you can use XAI Validate in two ways:
      - **Detect and Position** (Actuals only): instantly identify income, expenses, assets and liabilities, behavioural and risk insights.
      - **Verify and Decision** (Stated vs Actuals): ingest and verify customers’ declared financials against the actual financial position identified in the data. This also allows you to configure your credit policy automating responsible lending assessment decisions.      
      
    XAI Validate supports a range of data sources including:
      - popular data aggregators
      - connect your own data
      - Consumer Data Right support (coming soon!)
          
    ## Getting Started  

    The XAI Validate API provides a way to seamlessly integrate assessment of financial poistion into your workflow. The table below provides a summary of endpoints, which allow you to get "data in" and then "data out". You can use the [XAI Validate user interface](https://app.tictoc.ai) at any time to interact with your data and the automated assessment of financial position.
      
    You'll need the following to start developing:
      - sign-up for XAI Validate. [Contact us](mailto:enterprise@tictoc.ai) to discuss the right product and access to our `sandbox`
      - your client credentials for the XAI Validate user interface and API. These will provided to you by Tic:Toc, and must be stored securely
      - you're then ready to start developing against our test environment using the endpoints below. 
      

      | Endpoint Name| Description |
      |-----|-----|
      | [`/application/create`](#/financialvalidation/application/create) | Create an application linking your applicants, and their external data aggregator reference identifiers.  |
      | [`/application/manage`](#/financialvalidation/application/manage) | Update an existing application including adding "declared/stated" financials, updating applicant details or adding new external data aggregator reference identifiers.  |
      | [`/application/get`](#/financialvalidation/application/get) | Retrieve an existing application using an application reference number.  |
      | [`/provideaccounts`](#/financialvalidation/provideaccounts) | Connect your customers' account and transaction data against an existing application and applicant. This is ideal if you've sourced your own raw transaction data from core systems or through Open Banking.  |
      | [`/application/getstatus`](#/application/getstatus) |  Monitor the progress of automated financial assessment.  |
      | [`/result/getsummary`](#/result/getsummary)| Retrieve the results of automated financial assessment. The endpoint will surface automated assessments against your configured credit policy (where relevant), and validation figures for income, expenses, assets and liabilities. |
      | [`/serviceability/getserviceability`](#/serviceability/getserviceability)| Calculate serviceability for your application including income, expense, debt, borrowing amount and ratios. |
      | [`/token`](#/token) | XAI Validate uses OAuth2 authentication. Every time you call these endpoints you'll need to ensure you have a valid token.  |
      | [`/credit/enquiry`](#/credit/enquiry) | (Coming soon!) Make a credit enquiry based on key identifying information for an applicant.  |
      | [`/credit/getenquiry`](#/credit/getenquiry) | (Coming soon!) Retrieve the results of a credit enquiry detailing accounts and liabilities for an applicant.  |
      | [`/credit/getsummary`](#/credit/getsummary) | (Coming soon!) Retrieve the summary of credit policy rules applied to the credit enquiry for an applicant.  |
      | [`/document/upload`](#/document/upload) | Upload a document to an application or applicant. This endpoint returns a pre-signed URL to upload the document.  |
      | [`/document/get`](#/document/get) | Retrieve information about a specific document linked to an application or applicant.  |
      | [`/document/getlist`](#/document/getlist) | Retrieves the list of documents for an application or applicant.  |
      | [`/document/download`](#/document/download) | Retrieves the pre-signed URL to download the document.  |
      
    ## Data Model  
      
    When you interact with the XAI Validate user interface and APIs you'll notice there's a clear structure to the data. We've designed the XAI Validate data model to be optimised for automating assessment of financial position. The data hierarchy is:
      - **application**: this is the structure that holds all other elements and represents a point-in-time product application from your customer
      - **applicants**: an application can have one or more applicants (currently limited to two). Applicants can belong to multiple applications, e.g. a customer applying for a credit card and a home loan would exist in two applications
      - **households**: your applicants belong to households. For convenience we will assign applicants to a single, default household at the start of application
      - **accounts**: applicants own accounts, which can be held individually or jointly with the other  applicant on the application
      - **transactions**: these are the credits and debits against each account. Transactions are enriched with attributes such as categories, high risk flags and expense management. 
      - **documents**: each application and applicant can have a document linked, each with a defined type and format.

          description: Production authorisation server
      description: >-
        Before you can call the XAI Validate endpoints, you need to authenticate via the `/token` API. Successful authentication will return a token that can then be used to authorise your access to functional APIs. You'll need to include this token in the `Authorization` header in your calls.
          
        The `/token` API URL includes values in the query path. The URL will look like this:        
          `https://{host}/oauth2/token?grant_type=client_credentials`

        The `host` value will either be `auth.tictoc.ai` for production or `auth.stage.tictoc.ai` for testing.

        You'll also need to include information in your headers:
          - `Authorization`: Base64 encoded `client_id` and `client_secret` provided to you by the XAI Validate team as part of onboarding. The format is: `"Basic {client_id}:{client_secret}"`
          - `Content-Type`: the value is `"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`

        **Remember, your API credentials must be kept safe and secure. Do not share these or publish to publicly accessible locations such as your client-side code or GitHub.**

      summary: Create an application with up to two applicants and their external data aggregator references.
      description: >-
        This endpoint allows you to create an "application", which is the object that holds all elements and represents a point-in-time product application from your customer. XAI Validate assigns each application a unique `ApplicationReferenceNumber` (Arn). You can use this value for subsequent calls.
          
          
        When you create an application you determine the data sources and data validation type you need, namely:
         1. "Detect and Position" or "Verify and Decision": do you want XAI Validate to identify your customers' financial position and provide you with the insights or do you want XAI Validate to automate financial validation decisioning for you? If you choose a "Verify and Decision" approach you need to provide your customers' "declared" financials to the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.
         2. your customers: you can link one or more applicants to an application. XAI Validate will combine any jointly held accounts as part of the linking process.
         3. your customer data source: XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. See the table below for more information.
           
          
        The table below lists the parameters you need to populate based on your data validation choice above:

          | Function | Description |
          |-----|-----| 
          | `ApplicationContacts` | These are the applicants applying for your product. XAI Validate currently supports up to two applicants.|
          | `ExternalDataId`| This is the reference information for your existing data aggregator. XAI Validate currently supports multiple data sources - see the table below for information.|
          | `ExternalApplicationReferenceNumber`| This is an application reference from your own system to allow you to easily correlate the XAI Validate `ApplicationReferenceNumber` with your own records.|
          | `IsActualsOnly`| This parameter is only used by those clients that require a "verify and decision" approach to financial assessment. By setting this boolean to `false` these customers can then call the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manage) endpoint to add their applicants' "declared" or "stated" financials. This value will default to `true` meaning XAI Validate will return your applicants' "actual" financial position from the data. If don't pass a value for `IsActualsOnly`, then automated assessment will be triggered when you receive a successful response. If you're passing `"IsActualsOnly": false` then automated assessment will wait for you provide your applicants' "declared" financials via the [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoint.|
          | `Lender`| This optional parameter can be used to drive the credit policy against which you would like your application assessed. The code will be defined as part of your onboarding process. |
          
          
        XAI Validate supports multiple data sources. The table below describes the supported data sources and the request specifics. Depending on your XAI Validate client setup you will be able to use two data sources by  default - your chosen data aggregator and the connect your own data options:

          | illion ODS MultiBank | `MB` | None | A unique URL will be returned when you call the endpoint, which your customers can use to link their accounts. Their data will automatically synch with your XAI Validate application. |
          | Yodlee v1.1 | `YOD11` | A list of your Yodlee customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Yodlee customer identifier. |
          | Basiq (coming soon!) | `BSQ` | A list of your Basiq customer identifiers. | You should have a one to one linking of applicant to Basiq customer identifier. |
          | Connect your own data | `EXT` | None | By selecting `EXT` you will be required to upload your data to the application. Please see [`/financialvalidation/provideaccounts`](#/financialvalidation/provideaccounts) for more information. |

      description: >-

        This versatile endpoint allows you to perform the following functions against an existing application:
          | Function | Description |
          |-----|-----|        
          | Add/edit "stated/declared" financials against an application | This is only relevant if you require a "declare and verify" approach to financial assessment, and have passed the `"IsActualsOnly": false` parameter in your [`/application/create`](#Application/Create) request.|
          | Link additional data source to an application |This is useful when your applicants provide additional bank account information thorugh your data aggregator, and you need to rerun the automated assessment. Please see the table below for data source details. |
          | Add/edit applicants within an application| Add new applicants or edit existing ones. |
         
        When you call the endpoint, automated assessment will commence once you receive a successful response. You can monitor the progress using the [`/application/getstatus`](#/application/getstatus) endpoint. However, you can control when the automated assessments is started by using the `ApplicationStatus` parameter:
          - `Commenced`: hold automated assessment until you're ready. This is helpful if you're gradually building an application object as your customer completes their application.
          - `Assess`: trigger automated asssessment. As this is an optional parameter, `Assess` is the default status.
            
        Please note the assessment levels XAI Validate currently supports for providing "stated/declared" financials. These have been designed in line with lending best practices:
          
          | Assessment Level | Financial Types |
          |-----|-----|
          | `Application` | These are application-level financials (`DeclaredFinancialsApplication`) and currently accommodate  `AssetsCash` for assessment of your applicants' deposit|
          | `Household` | Your applicants will belong to `Households` and the `DeclaredFinancialsHousehold` object currently supports `ExpensesMonthly` for your applicants' household's monthly expenses |
          | `Applicant` | These are the applicant-specific financials, which includes a `IncomeSalary` figure, a list of `IncomeRental` values,  a list of `LiabilitiesHomeLoans` values, and single values for `LiabilitiesCreditCard*` and `LiabilitiesPersonalLoan*`|

        This endpoint allows you to submit your customers' account and transaction data against an existing application and applicant. This is ideal if you've sourced your own raw transaction data from core systems or through Open Banking.
          
        This option will be available if you have have provided the `"DataProviderName": "EXT"` value to either [`/application/create`](#/Application/Create) or [`/application/manage`](#/application/manageApplicationFinancials) endpoints.
          
        There are four steps to linking your own data to your applicants. 
          1. create your application through [`/application/create`](#/Application/Create). You'll need to set the following value in the request - `"DataProviderName": "EXT"`
          2. call this endpoint with a `POST` method and  your `ApplicationReferenceNumber` and a list of `ApplicationContacts` you wish to load data against.
          3. the response will return a one-time URL for each applicant in your request.
          4. call the one-time URL returned above with a `PUT` method, providing the account and transaction data in the body in the format shown in . You'll need to call this endpoint for each applicant.
          
        Once your customers' data has been uploaded the financial validation process will be triggered. You can monitor progress through  [`/financialvalidation/application/getstatus`](#/getFinancialValidationJob) and retrieve results from  [`/financialvalidation/result/getsummary`](#/getResultsSummary).

        This endpoint allows you to upload your customers data in a specific format. The unique upload URL will be returned in the [`/financialvalidation/provideaccounts`](#/manageAccountTransaction) endpoint response. A unique URL will be returned per applicant.
          
        Please note:
        * you will `PUT` the object to the `UploadUrl` directly, not to the XAI Validate endpoint.
        * no headers are required in the `PUT`.
          
        Once you have successfully uploaded the data, the automated financial validation process will be triggered.
           
        You can submit multiple accounts across financial institutions in a single request. The table below summarises the rquired request parameters at the `Account` and `Transaction` level:
          
          | Object Type| Required Parameters |
          |-----|-----|

      summary: Categorise and enrich expense transactions.
      description: >-

        This endpoint allows you to enrich raw expense transaction data with the following:
          * **category**: the LIXI Living Expense aligned expense category, including a prediction probability
          * **discretionary expense** (coming soon): an indicator as to whether the expense is discretionary spend, including a prediction probability
          * **expense merchant** (coming soon): the merchant for where the transaction was made
          * **high risk cash withdrawal** (coming soon): indicator as to whether the cash withdrawal is may be risky (one of multiple on the same day, greater than $2,000 or one of a series of cash withdrawals representing greater than 10% of the months' expenses)
          * **high risk merchant** (coming soon): an indicator as to whether the merchant is one of a configurable list of potentially risky merchants (e.g. gambling)
          * **adverse** (coming soon): indicator as to whether the transaction indicates potentially adverse behaviour (e.g. direct debit dishonour).
          * **internal transfer** (coming soon): indicator as to whether the transaction is an internal transfer.
            
        Here are a few important technical notes to remember:
          * this endpoint is synchronous, with results returned within seconds of your request
          * no data is persisted - each expense you provide is enriched, a response returned and that's it! No data is saved besides the metadata of your request (e.g. when, number of accounts, number of transactions)
          * only expenses are accepted (that is, `TransactionAmount` less than $0). If you provide credit transactions in your request, these will not be included in the response
          * a maximum of 5 accounts can be submitted in a single request
          * a total of 2,000 transactions can be submitted in a single request
           
        The request supports multiple account and transaction elements, and is consistent with the [`/financialvalidation/provideaccounts`](#/manageAccountTransaction) format. However, you don't need to supply all these elements. Below is an example of the minimal request:
          * `AccountType`: you must specify this for each list of transaction. If you don't know you can simply provide `NOTMATCHED`. The options are `TRANSACTION`, `CREDITCARD`, `HOMELOAN`, `PERSONALLOAN`
          * `TransactionPostedOn`: the date of the transaction within the `Transactions` list
          * `TransactionDescription`: the raw transaction description
          * `TransactionAmount`: the raw transaction amount with its sign. Remember, only expenses (amount < $0) are categorised by this endpoint.

        Retrieve the status of your automated financial assessment process. Financial validation has a diverse range of activities from retrieving provider data, normalising accounts and transactions, through to automated assessment of financial position. A `GroupId` will be returned in the response for the following endpoints, which you can use to monitor progress:
          - [`/application/create`](#/application/create)
          - [`/application/manage`](#/application/manage)
          
          We will return an overall status of the financial validation tasks. The status codes are:
          - `READY` - task processing has not yet started 
          - `PROCESSING` - task processing is underway
          - `COMPLETED` - task processing has completed successfully
          - `FAILED` - a task has failed processing. XAI Validate will retry the task, so continue to monitor.
          - `DEAD` - oops... something's gone wrong. No further processing takes place - we'll monitor the system for these issues.

      summary: Get serviceability metrics for an application and its applicants.
      description: >-

        This endpoint allows you to get serviceability metrics for your applications. By passing the `ApplicationReferenceNumber` for an existing application you can use the validated financials from earlier [`/application/create`](#Application/Create) and [`/application/manage`](#Application/Manage) requests to get accurate serviceability outputs.

        In each request you can provide a list of new facilities, for which serviceability metrics will be returned. 
          
        You will be required to supply the following required information:
          * `ApplicationReferenceNumber`: this will extract validated financials from the application object from earlier processes.
          * `NewFacilities`: specifics of the new debt facilities.
          * `ConfigurationSet`: the lending policy configuration for which you wish to calculate serviceability metrics. This will be the lender or product enumeration you have configured within XAI Validate

        If you require HEM calculations you can set the `IsHemRequired` optional parameter. This is set to `false` by default. If you set this value to `true` then you must provide the following additional values under the `ApplicationContacts` object:
          * `EmailAddress`

        You also have the ability to provide additional applicant and application level values over and above the outputs from earlier financial validation processes. These are optional - we will use validated figures and configured defaults where these are not provided. The table below lists the high level optional objects for tailoring serviceability calculations.
          
          | Optional Value | Purpose |
          |-----|-----|        
          | `ApplicantIncome` | Applicant-specific income values including self-employed income inputs and addbacks.|
          | `ApplicantDebt` | Applicant-specific liabilities including home loans and ownership percentage |
          | `ApplicationExpenses` | Household-specific expenses include non-discretionary expenses and HEM values |
           
        Please note:  
          * If your applicant is self employed you will need to set the `IsSelfEmployed` parameter within the `ApplicationContact` to `true`. This value is `false` by default.
          * If your applicant has a HECS debt you will need to set the `HasHecsDebt` parameter within the `ApplicationContact` to `true`. This value is `false` by default.
